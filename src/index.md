# Catalysis

Despite the decentralized nature of Internet's design,
it's experienced a centralization by cloud providers that seek to extract capital at any cost through convenient (and sometimes "free") developer solutions. 

Organizations and projects don't conceive giving up the model due to the **associated costs**.
The first one is monetary and we believe it's important to answer the question: [do we want to be a customer or a product?](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/07/16/product/).
For some organizations it's sensible to start as a product and become a customer later on.


The second one has to do with the developer ergonomics and convenience they they'd lose.


Those solutions are usually built in the context of financially-sustainable or VC-backed companies that can gear money towards marketing, design, and development efforts (e.g. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Fly](https://fly.io/), [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)) resulting in better products.
